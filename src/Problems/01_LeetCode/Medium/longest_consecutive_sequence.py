    Optimal:
        Time Complexity:  O(n) + O(n + n) => O(3n)
        Space Complexity: O(n)
    ---------------------
    Thought Process:
    Approach: Set
        1. Convert the array into a HashSet
            - This allows quick lookups (O(1) average time complexity).
            - Avoids duplicates (since sets automatically remove them).
        
        2. Initialize a variable longest_streak
            - Tracks the length of the longest consecutive sequence found.
        
        3. Iterate through each number in the set
            - Identify sequence start points:
                - A number is the start of a new sequence if (num - 1) is NOT in the set.
                - If (num - 1) exists, it means num is part of a sequence that has already been counted.
        4. Expand the sequence from the start point 
            - If num is a start point:
            - Set current_streak = 1 (since it includes itself).
            - Check if num + 1, num + 2, â€¦ exist in the set.
            - Continue until a number is missing.
            - Update longest_streak if current_streak is greater.
        5. Skip non-starting numbers
            - If (num - 1) exists in the set, skip num, as it belongs to an already processed sequence.
            
    ** This approach ensures an efficient O(n) runtime by avoiding redundant checks. **

    Example 1:
        Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
