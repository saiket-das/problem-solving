    ----------
    Example 1: 
        Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
        Output: "apbqcr"
        Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
        word1:  a   b   c
        word2:    p   q   r
        merged: a p b q c r
    ----------
    Example 2: 
        Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
        Output: "apbqrs"
        Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
        word1:  a   b 
        word2:    p   q   r   s
        merged: a p b q   r   s
    ----------
    Example 3:    
        Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
        Output: "apbqcd"
        Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
        word1:  a   b   c   d
        word2:    p   q 
        merged: a p b q c   d
