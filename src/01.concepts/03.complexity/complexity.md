## Defination:

The rate at which the time, required to run a code, changes with respect to the input size,
is considered the time complexity. Basically, the time complexity of a particular code depends
on the given input size, not on the machine used to run the code.

## RULES of Time Complexity

    1. Always Consider Worst Case
    2. Ignore Constant
    3. Avoid Lower Values
    4. Different Terms Are Added, Not Multiplied (O(n) + O(m))

| Big O | ------ | Theata θ | ------- | Omega Ω |
| Worst | ------ | Average | ------- | Best Case |

## Big O notation

    1. O(1)
    2. O(log(n))
    3. O(n)
    4. O(nlog(n))
    5. O(n^2)...
